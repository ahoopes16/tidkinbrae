# Tidkinbrae
This project will serve as the portfolio website for Kevin "Alex" Hoopes. It is being developed using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/), a performant React-based open source framework.

## Where to Find the Site
At the time of writing, this website has not been deployed yet, as I am still actively developing it. The plan is to buy a domain name and deploy it once I've completed [v1.0.0](https://github.com/ahoopes16/tidkinbrae/milestone/1), but that's still a month or two out.

## Contributing
Since this is my portfolio, and should only have information about me, I am not planning on accepting any contributions on this project.

If you take a look at it and have ideas for how to make it better, however, please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/ahoopes16/tidkinbrae/issues/new/choose).

## Why is it called Tid Kin Brae?

Tid Kin Brae comes from Scandinavian and Gaelic, which roughly translates to "Windy Hills". My father has done an incredible amount of geneological research on my family, and it turns out that every major Hoopes home throughout the last several hundred years has been named "Windy Hill" in some form or another.

As such, it seemed fitting that my "home" on the Internet would follow the same tradition.
